# Project : Explore Weather Trends

*Submitted by: Suraj Gurav*

This is the first project in [Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)

In this project, the local and global temperature data is analysed and temperature trends in a German city Munich were compared to overall global temperature trends.

## Prerequisites 

* Structured Query Language (SQL)
* Microsoft Excel
* Python

## Overview

The goal of this project was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the German city Munich. 
This goal was achieved in the following steps.

1. The city and global level data is extracted using _SQL_ query.
2. The extracted data is stored in _.csv_ format.
3. The _.csv_ file is imported into Pandas dataframe, processed and visualizations were created.

The average temperature data from the year 1750 till 2014 for a German city Munich is compared with the global temperature data in the same time frame. I found an increasing trend in the average temperature of entire world from begining of 20th century.
The moving average of temperature is considered for plotting the data as shown in below figure.

Additionally, box plots, scatter plots and bar plots are created to get more insights into the data
